CL-ztree-diff
=============
cl-ztree-diff (cl-zdiff) is a text-mode directory-diff tool inspired by commercial tools like Beyond Compare or Araxis Merge.  
It is an attempt to remake [ztree-diff](https://github.com/fourier/ztree) as a stand-alone ncurses-based application, therefore it is implemented in Common Lisp
